/**
 * The YouTube extraction surface — intent-level twins of the engine bundle's `yt/…` commands
 * (engine-js `logic/yt/commands.ts`), shaped like the legacy `ExtractorLibWrapper`: the app states
 * WHAT it wants (the home feed, a playlist page behind an app link, a search), never HOW YouTube
 * serves it. All browseIds, params protobufs and Mix mechanics live in the engine; the app's only
 * currencies are engine-composed app links (round-tripped verbatim), opaque continuations, and the
 * user's own input (a query, a tapped video). Each call pins the manager's current engine, streams
 * one JSON args head to the pipe with a [JsonWriter], stream-parses one JSON result back with a
 * [JsonReader], and decodes an engine RESET into the typed [EngineError] — no reflective
 * (de)serializer touches the wire.
